Twitter for iPhone,Just reported that the United States has done far more “testing” than any other nation by far! In fact over an eight day span the United States now does more testing than what South Korea (which has been a very successful tester) does over an eight week span. Great job!,03-25-2020 14:44:17,35386,195728,FALSE,1242824631230308353

Twitter for iPhone,I am working very hard to help New York City &amp; State. Dealing with both Mayor &amp; Governor and producing tremendously for them including four new medical centers and four new hospitals. Fake News that I won’t help them because I don’t like Cuomo (I do). Just sent 4000 ventilators!,03-25-2020 10:40:52,32226,162796,FALSE,1242763375924391936
